# Regression

In a regression model the goal is to predict an outcome of given some input data. This statistical process try to estimate the relations among different variables of the form:
\\[
Y=f(X,\beta)
\\]
We try to predict the value of the $$Y$$ variable given the dependent variables $$X$$. $$\beta$$ are the unknown parameters that have do be inferred to produce the fittest output.

More information and methods about regression [here](regression).

# Classification

Classification is used when the outcome are categorical variables.

# Association Rules

These algorithms allow automatic discovery of complex associations in a data set.
