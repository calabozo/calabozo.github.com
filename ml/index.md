# Metaheuristic

[Metaheuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic) is a higher-level procedure or heuristic designed to find, generate, or select a heuristic (partial search algorithm) that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem, especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity.[1] Metaheuristics sample a set of solutions which is too large to be completely sampled. Metaheuristics may make few assumptions about the optimization problem being solved, and so they may be usable for a variety of problems.

# Regression

In a regression model the goal is to predict an outcome of given some input data.

## Regression Decision Tree


# Classification

Classification is used when the outcome are categorical variables.

# Association Rules

These algorithms allow automatic discovery of complex associations in a data set.
