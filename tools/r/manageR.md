## Managing data

* seq(pi,9) : sequence of numbers
  * seq_along(xx), seq(alongwith=xx) : sequence mimics
  * seq(-10,10,length.out=100)  : length 100
* rep(0, times = xx) : repeats a number
  * rep(c(0,1,2), times = 10)
  * rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)
* paste(my_char, collapse = " ") : concatenates strings
  * paste(1:3,c("X","Y","Z"),sep="")
  * paste(c("0x",unlist(strsplit("aa:bb:cc",":"))),collapse="")
* sample(t,100,repalace=TRUE) : takes a sample with or without replacement
  * myDataFrame[sample(nrow(myDataFrame),100), ]
* identical(vect, vect2) : Checks if two objects are equal
* cbind(x,y) : Concatenate by columns
* rbint(x,y) : Concatenate by rows
* rank(y) - Returns the sample ranks of the values in a vector
  * rank(sort(x))
* reorder(x, y) : By default treats its first argument as a categorical variable, and reorders its levels based on the values of a second variable
* which(x>0) : Give the ‘TRUE’ indices of a logical object, allowing for array indices.
* numeric(3) : Creates a vector of the given length
* identical(x,y) : will return TRUE if the two R objects passed to it as arguments are identical
* any(x<0): to see if any of the elements of x are less than zero
* all(x>0): to see if any of the elements of x are greater than zero
* which.min

## Working with strings

* substr(x, start, stop): Extract or replace substrings in a character vector
* substring(x, start, stop=100000): Extract or replace substrings in a character vector
* strsplit(ip, "\\.")  : Split the elements of a character vector ‘x’ into substrings according to the matches to substring ‘split’ within them.
  * sapply(strsplit(listOfemails,"@"),"[",2) : Gets the domain from a list of emails
* 

## Inspecting variables
* attributes(x) : Shows object's attributes
* names(x) : Shows object's names
* class(x) : Shows object's class
* unclass(x) : Shows internal object value
* str(x) : Shows internal structure of the object
* object.size(x) : Provides an estimate of the memory that is being used to store an R object
  * sapply(ls(),function(x){format(object.size(get(x)),units="Mb")}) : Show all the object size in Megabytes


## Working with NA

* mice::md.pattern(x)        - Display missing-data patterns
* mice::mice(x, method='rf') - Generates Multivariate Imputations by Chained Equations (MICE).
* mice::complete(mice_out)   - Fills NA with the model generated by mice


## Working with tables

* admargins(matrix) : Add a column and a row with the Sum of its elements
* prop.table(matrix) : Calculate the relative probability


## Merging data
* merge(x,y,by="colT")
* match(x,y)  returns a vector of the positions of (first) matches of its first argument in its second.
* x %in% y returns a logical vector indicating if there is a match or not for its left operand.
* unique(x)
* duplicated(x) determines which elements of a vector or data frame are duplicates
