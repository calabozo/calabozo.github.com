- name: Hadoop
  img: img/Hadoop.png
  url: http://hadoop.apache.org/
  desc: The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

  desc: Elasticsearch is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud. It is build on top of Lucene. Elasticsearch lets you perform and combine many types of searches — structured, unstructured, geo, metric — any way you want. Start simple with one question and see where it takes you. Elasticsearch aggregations let you zoom out to explore trends and patterns in your data.

- name: Kibana
